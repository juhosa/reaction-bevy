# re-action, Bevy version

This is a Bevy version of my short game "re-action".

## Assets

Since bevy doesn't ship with a default font, we need to add one ourselves.

Because of reasons, this repo doesn't ship the font either. You can download one from the web (for example from nerdfonts).
Copy the `.ttf`-file in to the `assets`-directory and name the file `font.ttf`.
